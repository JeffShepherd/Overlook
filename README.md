# Overlook

Overlook is the final solo Mod-2 project in the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). This application is intended to be a user dashboard for viewing, and booking, reservations at a ficitonal hotel. After logging in, a user is able to view their past and future reservations, as well as search for rooms by date and room type. 

[Original Project Specifications](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/overlook.html)

Learning goals and objects are as follows:

- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

cd into directory and run:

```
npm install
```

To start the server, run:

```

### Overlook Application

Clone down this repository and install the library dependencies by running:
